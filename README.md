# Bluetooth Switch Interface

Switch interfaces typically allow people with physical disabilities access and input into a range of computing devices. They will typically send a keystroke to the device. This can be used to operate the switch control features built into iOS and Android, and software in Microsft Windows based systems. They can form a key part of an Assistive Technology system.

This switch interface based on the Arduino-based [Adafruit Feather 32u4 Bluefruit LE development board](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-32u4-bluefruit-le/overview). These are available from a range of suppliers including [Pimoroni](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/adafruit-feather-32u4-bluefruit-le).

A work in progress currently using a prototype board!
